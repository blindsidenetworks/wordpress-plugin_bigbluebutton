== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**I've migrated my rooms. Now it says they're missing when I try to access them!**
Please try going to settings, and save permalinks. There is no need to change your permalink structure.

**I'm an admin and when I tried to enter a room, I couldn't enter as a moderator.**
Please try deactivating the plugin, and reactivating it again.

**How do I create meetings?**
After activating the BigBlueButton plugin, click on "Rooms" and "Add New" and give the meeting a title and fill out the room details.

**How can users join the meetings?**

Users join meetings using a join room form. This form can be shown in a site as a sidebar element or as a page/post.

For setting up in the sidebar, add the bigbluebutton widget, as you do with any other widget, dragging the box to the position you want it to be in.

By default each room will be on its own page, with the permalink listed in the Rooms page on the admin panel. Rooms can also be inserted into any post/page using the [bigbluebutton] shortcode with specified tokens, token1, token2 in the shortcode in the format, [bigbluebutton token="token1,token2"].

**How can users view recordings?**

By default, each room will have its own page, which will display the room description, join button, and the recordings.

To place recordings on a separate post/page, use the shortcode [bigbluebutton type="recording"], with the room tokens of the desired recordings. For example, the recordings for the tokens, token1, token2 can be displayed using [bigbluebutton type="recording" token="token1, token2"].

**Why sometimes the Name and Password are required, some others only the Name and others only the Password?**

The plugin gathers the much information it cans from Wordpress, but what will be taken depends of the configuration.

For registered users their registered name or username will be taken as Name.

For registered users whose role has ben set for requiring always a password, only the Password will be required.

For anonymous users the Name will be always required, but again the Password requirment will depend of the configuration. If Moderator/Attendee capability has been set for them no Password box will be shown in their join room form.

**How can I change permissions of the users?**

You should install and activate the "Members" plugin by Justin Tadlock and in the Dasboard under the "Users" > "Roles", update the permissions.

To allow another user to create and edit rooms, assign them a role which has the permissions, edit_plugins and edit_bbb_rooms, publish_bbb_rooms, delete_bbb_rooms, delete_published_bbb_rooms, and edit_published_bbb_rooms. The permission structure is similar for posts and pages.

To allow another user to create and edit room categories, assign them a role which has the permissions, edit_plugins and manage_categories. This does not give them permission to create rooms. They can only manage room categories.

To allow another user to join as moderator, viewer, or with a code, assign them to a role with one of the corresponding permissions, join_as_moderator_bbb_room, join_as_viewer_bbb_room, or join_with_password_bbb_room. By default, the owner of the room will always join their rooms as a moderator. The default does not apply to others' rooms.

To allow another user to manage recordings, assign them to a role which has the permissions, manage_bbb_room_recordings.

To allow another user to use shortcodes or the widget, assign them to a role which has the permissions, edit_bbb_rooms.

If there are no roles with the corresponding permissions, please create a custom role using the "Members" plugin and assign the permission to that role.

**Is there any way users can go directly into a meeting?**

Since version 1.3.4 it is possible to provide direct access to the meeting rooms by adding the meeting token ID to the shortcode: (eg. [bigbluebutton token="aa2817f3a1e1"]).

The joining form is the same, so with the right permission configuration users would be able to join meetings in one click.

**Why is it giving an error about creating a meeting room?**

Make sure you are using BigBlueButton 0.8 or higher. Ensure the server settings are configured correctly.

**How can I improve security?**

You should enable the curl extension in php.ini.

**I tried to preview my room, and nothing showed up!**

Rooms may not be viewed until they are published. This is because room settings cannot be changed after publication, and we want to be certain the settings are how you like them.

**I want to edit my recordings. How do I do that?**

If a user has the capability to manage recordings, they will see a pencil icon next to recording name and description. Click on the icon to start editing, and press enter to submit. A user can cancel editing by pressing the ESC key.
